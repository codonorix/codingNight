In this challenge you are given three different inputs

* Two letters
* A string

# The Challenge
You need to take the users string and the two letters of choice. As per the example below

```py 
message('user message', 'e', 'g')
```

With this information in mind...

* The user message should be any string
* e will be the main letter we check for
* g will be the letter that will determine a true or false return value

Now we need to make a program that checks if 'e' is always before 'g' and never after it. So in the example above we will return a 'false' output.

This is because there is an 'e' and the end of the user's string which means that it's after 'g' meaning that we'll return a 'false' output. 

Here are a couple more examples...

```py
message('potatoes', 'e', 's') #Returns true as 'e' is always before 's'
```

```py
message('dogs are cute', 'e', 't') #Returns false as 't' is before 'e' at the end of the sentence
```

# The rules

* You are in groups, so typically that would mean you should work as a group, don't run off and use your IDE now.
* All work should be done in repl.it (This is because I hate you, it's just good to practice not using an IDE for a job interview).
* Attempt to avoid using external resources, use your big brains together (however, you are allowed to google, but copy pasting code is a nono).
